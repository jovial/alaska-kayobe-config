# This inventory section provides a mapping of the components to top level
# groups.
#
# Top level groups define the roles of hosts, e.g. controller or compute.
# Components define groups of services, e.g. nova or ironic.
# Services define single containers, e.g. nova-compute or ironic-api.
#
# NOTE: Changes from the default mappings are marked with CUSTOMISED. See
# the git history for full details.
